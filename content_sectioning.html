    <table>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Element</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&ltaddress&gt</td>
        <td>
          The &ltaddress&gt HTML element indicates that the enclosed HTML
          provides contact information for a person or people, or for an
          organization.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&ltarticle&gt</td>
        <td>
          The &ltarticle&gt HTML element represents a self-contained composition
          in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be
          independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication).
          Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a
          blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, an interactive
          widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&ltaside&gt</td>
        <td>
          The &ltaside&gt HTML element represents a portion of a document whose
          content is only indirectly related to the document's main content.
          Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&ltfooter&</td>
        <td>
          The &ltfooter& HTML element represents a footer for its nearest
          sectioning content or sectioning root element. A &ltfooter& typically
          contains information about the author of the section, copyright data
          or links to related documents.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&ltheader&gt</td>
        <td>
          The &ltheader&gt HTML element represents introductory content,
          typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain
          some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name,
          and other elements.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&lth1&gt,&lth2&gt,&lth3&gt,&lth4&gt,&lth5&gt,&lth6&gt,</td>
        <td>
          The &lth1&gt to &lth6&gt HTML elements represent six levels of section
          headings. &lth1&gt is the highest section level and &lth6&gt is the
          lowest.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&ltmain&gt</td>
        <td>
          The &ltmain&gt HTML element represents the dominant content of the
          body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is
          directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document,
          or the central functionality of an application.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&ltnav&gt</td>
        <td>
          The &ltnav&gt HTML element represents a section of a page whose
          purpose is to provide navigation links, either within the current
          document or to other documents. Common examples of navigation sections
          are menus, tables of contents, and indexes.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&ltsection&gt</td>
        <td>
          The &ltsection&gt HTML element represents a generic standalone section
          of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to
          represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very few
          exceptions.td>
