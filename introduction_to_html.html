      <h3>HTML history and definition</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://w3.org" target="_blank">W3C</a> and WHATWG initially
        developed <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. It was
        initially developed in 1993. W3C mainly checks for standards of Html and
        other stuff. Since the initial release, lots of version of Html has been
        developed. Initially, its version is 1.0 or simply HTML. HTML stands for
        Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a
        markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup
        language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup
        language is used to define the text document within tag which defines
        the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (at the
        note for computer) text so that a machine can understand it and
        manipulate text accordingly. Most of the markup (e.g. HTML) languages
        are human readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation
        has to be done on the text. It is used for structuring and presenting
        the content on the web pages. HTML5 is the fifth version of HTML. Many
        elements are removed or modified from HTML5.
      </p>
      <span>
        All HTML documents must start with a
        <strong>!DOCTYPE</strong> declaration. The declaration is not an HTML
        tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to
        expect. In older documents (HTML 4 or XHTML), the declaration is more
        complicated because the declaration must refer to a DTD (Document Type
        Definition).

        width="400"
      />
      <p>
        According to
        <a href="https://www.educba.com/versions-of-html" target="_blank"
          ><em>Educba.com</em></a
        >
        HTML had 5 main versions, including todays HTML 5.
      </p>
      <ol class="html-versions">
        <li>
          <b>HTML 1.0</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The basic version of HTML has support for basic elements like text
              controls and images. This was the very basic version of HTML with
              less support for a wide range of HTML elements. It does not have
              rich features like styling and other things that were related to
              how content will be rendered in a browser.
            </li>
            <li>
              The initial version of HTML does not provide support for tables,
              font support, etc., as it provides us in the latest version.
            </li>
            <li>
              We would also like to discuss that W3C did not exist before HTML
              2.0; hence it does not show details about HTML 1.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>HTML 2</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTML version 2.0 was developed in 1995 with basic intention of
              improving HTML version 1.0
            </li>
            <li>
              Now a standard got started to develop so as to maintain common
              rules and regulations across different browsers. HTML 2.0 has
              improved a lot in terms of the markup tags. In HTML 2.0 version
              concept of form came into force. Forms were developed, but still,
              they had basic tags like text boxes, buttons, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also, the table came as an
              <a href="https://www.educba.com/basic-html-tags/" target="_blank"
                ><em>TML tag</em></a
              >. Now, in HTML tag 2.0, browsers also came with the concept of
              creating their own layers of tags that were specific to the
              browser itself. W3C was also formed. The main intention of W3C is
              to maintain standard across different web browsers so that these
              browsers understand and render HTML tags in a similar manner.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>HTML 3.2</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It was developed in 1997. After HTML 2.0 was developed, the next
              version of HTML was 3.2.
            </li>
            <li>
              With version 3.2 of HTML, HTML tags were further improved. It is
              worth noting that because of W3C standard maintenance, the newer
              version of HTML was 3.2 instead of 3.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, HTML 3.2 has better support for new form elements. Another
              important feature what HTML 3.2 implemented was support for CSS.
              CSS stands for
              <a href="https://www.educba.com/what-is-css/" target="_blank"
                ><em>Cascading Style Sheet</em></a
              >. It is CSS that provides features to make HTML tags look better
              on rendering it on browsers. CSS helps to style HTML elements.
            </li>
            <li>
              With the upgradation of browsers to HTML 3.2, the browser also
              supported for
              <a
                href="https://www.educba.com/frame-tag-in-html/"
                target="_blank"
                ><em>frame tags</em></a
              >, although HTML specifications still do not support frame markup
              tags.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>HTML 4.01</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It was developed in 1999. It extended the support of cascading
              styling sheets. In version 3.2, CSS were embedded in HTML page
              itself. Therefore, if the website has various web pages to apply
              to the style of each page, we must place CSS on each web page.
              Hence there was a repetition of the same block of CSS.
            </li>
            <li>
              To overcome this thing, in version 4.01 concept of an external
              styling sheet emerged. Under this concept, an external CSS file
              could be developed, and this external styling file could be
              included in HTML itself. HTML 4.01 provided support for further
              new tags of HTML.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>HTML 5</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              This is the latest version of HTML. For a developer, it could be
              used in 2014. It came up with lots of HTML tags support.
              <a href="https://www.educba.com/html5-elements/" target="_blank"
                ><em>HTML5</em></a
              >
              provided support for new form elements like input element s of
              different types; geolocations
              <a href="https://www.educba.com/html-geolocation/" target="_blank"
                ><em>support tags</em></a
              >, etc.

      <h3>HTML 5 tags which were added</h3>
      <ul class="html5-list">
        <li>
          <b>Email</b> – New HTML5 tag, which was added, is the input element of
          type email. This is a form tag, although it could be used outside of a
          form tag also. This tag checks the validation of the input value. It
          checks whether the value inserted is a valid email.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Password</b> – This is another form tag that was added to receive a
          password from the user. Being the password type field, the user types
          in the field are not visible directly to the user but are represented
          by special symbols. These symbols save the password from getting
          revealed on the browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Audio tag</b> – This is a new audio tag that was implemented in
          <a href="https://www.educba.com/html5-elements/" target="_blank"
            ><em>HTML5</em></a
          >. This tag helps to add audio to our web page. We can use this tag to
          embed an audio clip into a web page. This audio tag could be played on
          a webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Semantic tags</b> – Semantic tags are also known as structural
          tags. Structural tags are the tags that provide structure to the HTML
          page. It helps it divide the HTML page into different structures.
          These structures get combined into an HTML page itself to form an HTML
          web page. Few of the important HTML semantic tags are figcaption,
          header, footer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Section tag</b> – This tag is used to semantic a section in an HTML
          page. A
          <a href="https://www.educba.com/html-section-tag/" target="_blank"
            ><em>section tag</em></a
          >
          represents a section on a web page.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        There are lots of version of HTML which is being developed. From an
        initial version of 1.0 to the latest version of 5.2, HTML has developed
        a lot. W3C has also maintained standards so that all browsers could have
        a common standard to follow. HTML5 has developed a lot with new tags and
        the support of form elements.
