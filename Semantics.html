      <h3>Semantics</h3>
      <p>
        In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for
        example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or
        "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what
        does it look like?".)
      </p>

      <h3>Semantics in JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and
        returns an li element with that string as its textContent. Would you
        need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was
        called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?
      </p>

      <h3>Semantics in CSS</h3>
      <p>
        In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different
        types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected
        with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?
      </p>
    </section>
    <main>
      <header><h2>Semantics in HTML</h2></header>
      <p>
        In HTML, for example, the &lth1&gt element is a semantic element, which
        gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level
        heading on your page."
      </p>
      <p>
        By default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an &lth1&gt
        with a large font size to make it look like a heading (although you
        could style it to look like anything you wanted). On the other hand, you
        could make any element look like a top level heading. Consider the
        following: &ltspan style="font-size: 32px; margin: 21px 0;"&gtIs this a
        top level heading?&lt/span&gt
      </p>
      <p>
        This will render it to look like a top level heading, but it has no
        semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits as described
        above. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the
        right job. <br />HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be
        populated and not based on its default presentation styling.
        Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.
        <br />Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to
            influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired
            users navigate a page
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than
            searching through endless divs with or without semantic or
            namespaced classes
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s)
        best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?" For
        example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article
        with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out
        definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it
        have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header
        and footer?; etc.
